- **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)**: For machine learning models and preprocessing
- **[grouped-timeserie-cv](https://pypi.org/project/grouped-timeserie-cv/)**: For proper time series cross-validation
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive analysis and development in VSCode

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Easy access to real transit data from TESS, Kepler, and K2 missions
- **Preprocessing**: Robust pipeline for detrending, outlier removal, and normalization
- **Feature Engineering**: Time-based features and transit detection algorithms
- **ML Models**: Multiple algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks
- **Time Series Validation**: Proper cross-validation respecting temporal structure
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for improved performance
- **VSCode Integration**: Optimized settings for Jupyter notebook development

    TransitClassifier,
    GroupedTimeSeriesValidator
)

# Initialize components
data_loader = TransitDataLoader()
preprocessor = TransitPreprocessor()
classifier = TransitClassifier(model_type="random_forest")

# Load real exoplanet data
targets = data_loader.get_known_exoplanet_targets(max_targets=3)
light_curves = data_loader.load_multiple_targets(targets, mission="TESS")

# Preprocess and train
for target, lc in light_curves.items():
    df = data_loader.extract_features_from_lightcurve(lc)
    processed_df = preprocessor.process_light_curve(df)
    # ... continue with training
```

## Core Components

### 1. TransitDataLoader
- Downloads light curves from TESS, Kepler, K2 missions
- Handles data caching and preprocessing
- Provides access to known exoplanet targets

### 2. TransitPreprocessor  
- Detrends light curves using multiple methods (biweight, Savitzky-Golay, median)
- Removes outliers using robust statistics
- Normalizes flux values
- Creates time-based features for ML

### 3. TransitClassifier
- Supports multiple ML algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, etc.)
- Automatic feature engineering
- Model persistence and loading
- Ensemble methods for improved performance

### 4. GroupedTimeSeriesValidator
- Proper time series cross-validation
- Handles grouped data (multiple targets)
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Temporal and grouped train-test splits

## Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Acquisition**: Download transit light curves using lightkurve
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean, detrend, and normalize the data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create time-based and statistical features
4. **Label Creation**: Identify transit events from flux dips
5. **Model Training**: Train multiple ML models
6. **Validation**: Use grouped time series cross-validation
7. **Evaluation**: Assess performance with proper metrics

## Time Series Cross-Validation

The project uses proper time series validation to avoid data leakage:

- **Temporal Splits**: Train on earlier data, test on later data
- **Grouped Splits**: Separate targets between train/test sets  
- **Gap Handling**: Optional gaps between train and test periods
- **Multiple Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC

## VSCode Integration

Optimized settings for development:

- Jupyter notebook support
- Python environment detection
